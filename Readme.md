The Project has been specifically developed for researchers to help in Data Entry.

Problem Statement:
In the real world data, data collection becomes an immense responsibility. It has become quintessential to have a proper platform to enter the data without any mistake. As a step towards that, we developed a GUI using Python library called Tkinter and stored the information provided by data entry technicians. This information is further consumed by researchers to perform machine learning algo's etc., to find meaningful insights.

This solution is performed in two stages,

1] Using the Tkinter library for further analysis. It is a very simple solution yet powerfull. The GUI is a classic 90's looking theme. yet it can be altered and tinkered.

2] There are many pages in this app. The last page has google maps API embedded inside it, which allows the data entry technicians to enter the value based on the observed location. It involves using Rest Apis for communication between the main application and Google Maps.

3] The exact application has also been built in PHP for researcher convenience.

4] The logics in the program can be reduced greatly by placing them in separate classes and modularising it. But left like this for a purpose, as researchers would just need to change (x,y) coordinates and add more fields without any issues.

5] The Result in both methods are stored in the CSV files and are retrieved and manipulated by researchers according to their usage.
